# How does one add problems?

Create a file, titled `problem_name_here.md`, and a folder, titled `problem_name_here`.

# How does one add solutions?

Put your solution in the folder, and name it `your_name_n.xx` where `n` is the number of your solution, starting from 1.

# How does one update the leaderboard?

Use the `time` command to time your program. For example, `time python3 largest_plaindrome_product/wei_en_1.py` gives:

```
[wei2912@localhost projecteuler]$ time python3 problem4.py
906609

real    0m1.718s
user    0m1.710s
sys     0m0.005s
```

To find the time that your program takes to run, add up `user` and `sys` to get 0m1.715s. Put your answer on the leaderboard, so that it can be verified for correctness.
