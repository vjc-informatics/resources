## Learning C++
> How to start off well and make good progress.

It is recommended that you learn C++11. To start off, borrow this book: [Stroustrup: The C++ Programming Language (4th Edition)](http://www.stroustrup.com/4th.html). It's a great book on C++11 by the creator himself.

For a good source of documentation, use [C++ Reference](http://en.cppreference.com/w/) and avoid other websites like [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/).

## Learning Git

Those new to Github and version control may find this
[cheatsheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
and the other materials on their training website helpful. Another solution is
to learn [Git from the bottom
up](https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/).

## Algorithms

For those new to algorithms, take a look at online courses. The [Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) specialization on Coursera by Stanford university is highly recommended. (The author has not tried out the new courses ever since the old course was split up into 4 courses, but believes that the quality should be consistent.)

An alternative course, of very high quality too, is [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-algorithms) and [Algorithms, Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-data-structures-algorithms-2) by Princeton University. However, this course is in Java and may not be very useful.

For an overview of the main topics covered which are relevant to competitive programming, take a look at this table. Double ticks indicates a very comprehensive analysis of the topic in the course, relative to the other course. The important topics for competitive programming are marked with an asterisk (\* means you should know why it works in great detail).
