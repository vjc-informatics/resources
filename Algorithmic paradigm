Brute force algorithm

Description: It generates all possible solutions to the problem and checks every solution whether the possible solution solve the problem.

Analogy: To break a number lock, you turn the digits on the number lock from 1 to 9 systematically to find the password word.

Pros: This algorithm will always work and it is the most basic for all programmers.

Cons: Due to huge generation of all possible soltuions, it is the most ineffecient way in solving the problem.

Greedy algorithm

Description: It takes the best possible option at each step.

Analogy: When finding change for the person with the minimal spend of coins, you give the highest value coin first and follow by the next
highest coin value. Therefore, 70 cents change will be one 50 cents coin follow by one 20 cents coin instead of fourteen 5 cents coins.

Pros: It is the most optimise way of solving the problem if the problem can be solved using greedy.

Cons; There are situation by which picking the best option at that point in time will not result in the overall best output.
